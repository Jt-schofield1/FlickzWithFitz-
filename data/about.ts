  bio: "Hi, I'm Cameron Fitzsimmons, the photographer behind FlickzWithFitz, based in Erie, PA. With over a decade of experience behind the lens, I specialize in capturing moments that are authentic, timeless, and true to life.\n\nPhotography has always been my way of slowing down time. Life moves fast, but a great photo can hold on to the feeling of a single second forever.\n\nWhether you're celebrating a milestone, tying the knot, updating a portrait, or simply want to capture an honest moment, I'm here to help you turn real life into lasting memories.",
  description: "I believe that photography is more than just taking pictures; it's about freezing time and preserving memories that will last a lifetime. My approach combines technical expertise with creative vision to deliver images that are not only visually striking but emotionally resonant.",
